## Installation

      (use `--depth=1` if you don't need the history)
    * [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
    * From a command line opened in the folder, run `composer install` to install pH7CMS's dependencies.
  * Composer:
    * [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
    * `composer create-project ph7software/ph7cms --prefer-dist ph7cms`
  * Sourceforge:

## Nginx Configuration

In order to get pH7CMS working on nginx server, you need to add some custom nginx configuration.

Create `/etc/nginx/ph7cms.conf` and add the following:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    index index.php;
}
```

*Please note that the above code is the strict minimum and obviously you can add more rules by comparing with the [main Apache .htaccess file](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/.htaccess).*

Finally, in your nginx server configuration, you will have to include `ph7cms.conf` file to complete the configuration like below:

In file, e.g., *`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yoursite.conf`* for Ubuntu and other OS based on Debian or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/yoursite.conf` for CentOS and other OS based on Red Hat.

```nginx
server {
    # Port number. In most cases, 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
    listen 80;

    server_name www.yoursite.com;
    root /var/www/ph7cms_public_root;
    index index.php; #you can use index.ph7; for hidding the *.php ...
    client_max_body_size 50M;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.access.log;

    # Include ph7cms.conf. You can also directly add the "location" rule instead of including the conf file
    include /etc/nginx/ph7cms.conf;
}
```

For more information, please refer to the nginx documentation.

## pH7CMS; The Eco-Friendly CMS ❤️

![Eco Friendly. Love the World and Love the Nature](static/img/love-nature.svg)

[pH7CMS](http://ph7cms.com) has been built to reduce the power and CPU usage of your server in order to preserve the nature and help to save our environment.

* **GIMP** for editing the assets, etc.

* **Trimage** (and **ImageOptim** when developing on Mac) for compressing &amp; optimizing the images

* **Poedit** for translating the Gettext files

* **FileZilla** for FTP client

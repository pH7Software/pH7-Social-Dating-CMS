## Overview

**pH7 Dating CMS** is a **Social/Dating CMS** written in **Object-Oriented** PHP (*OOP*), fully compatible and highly optimised for PHP 7+ and based on **MVC** architecture (Model-View-Controller).

It is designed with the **KISS** principle in mind, and the all source code can be read and understood in minutes. For a better flexibility, the software uses **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) abstraction which allows the choice of the database. The principle of development is **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds (not duplicate code).

This Free and Open Source **Social Dating Site Builder** wants to be low resource-intensive, powerful, stable and secure. The software also comes with 34 system modules and is based on **pH7Framework** *(written specifically for this project)* that has over 52 packages.

*To summarize, **pH7CMS** gives you **the perfect ingredients** to create the **best dating service** or **social networking** website on the World Wide Web!*

## Nginx Configuration

In order to get pH7CMS working on nginx server, you need to add some custom nginx configuration.

Create `/etc/nginx/ph7cms.conf` and add the following:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    index index.php;
}
```

*Please note that the above code is the strict minimum and obviously you can add more by comparing with the [main Apache .htaccess file](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/.htaccess).*


Now in your nginx server configuration you will have to include `ph7cms.conf` file to complete the configuration like below:

In file, e.g., *`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yoursite.conf`* for Ubuntu and other OS based on Debian or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/yoursite.conf` for CentOS and other OS based on Red Hat.

```nginx
server {
    # Port number. In most cases, 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
    listen 80;

    server_name www.yoursite.com;
    root /var/www/ph7cms_public_root;
    index index.php; #you can use index.ph7; for hidding the *.php ...
    client_max_body_size 50M;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/yoursite.access.log;

    # Include ph7cms.conf. You can also directly add the "location" rule instead of including the conf file
    include /etc/nginx/ph7cms.conf;
}
```

For more information, please refer to the nginx documentation.

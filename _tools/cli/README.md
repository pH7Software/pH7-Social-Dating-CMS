# 🚀 pH7Builder CLI

## Installation Wizard  🧙

### The first CLI Dating Builder Installer Tool 😻 (ever invented! 🪄)

### 🤔 How to use it?

Inside of this folder (`_tools/cli`), run `php ph7cms setup:install`

Then, follow the instructions.

## 💡 Good to know

When using this cli command to install pH7Builder (AKA pH7CMS), you have to make sure that you didn't rename
the `_protected` folder.

The database configuration has less options. For instance, you can't change the prefix when creating the tables in the
database, meaning you won't be able to have two same installations using the same database (if so, you will have to
create a second database, or using the [traditional Web installer](http://ph7cms.com/doc/en/insall) instead).

## 🤕 Troubleshooting

them [by raising an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/issues).

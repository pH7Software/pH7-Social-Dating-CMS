## The first CLI Dating Builder Installer Tool 😻 (ever invented! 🪄)


### 🍰 Get started. How to use?

Inside this folder (`_tools/cli`), run `php ph7cms setup:install`

Then, follow the instructions.

For GitHub issue maintenance, you can also run:

`php ph7cms github:issues:resolve 1202 1201 --dry-run`

Useful options:

- `--comment-file=/path/to/comment.md` to post the same comment on every issue
- `--comment-dir=/path/to/comments` to load one Markdown file per issue number, such as `1202.md`
- `--close` to close the issues after commenting
- `--dry-run` to inspect the planned actions without modifying GitHub

The command uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` from the environment for authenticated comment and close operations.
Prefer environment variables over `--token` so the secret does not end up in shell history.


## 💡 Good to Know

When using this cli command to install pH7Builder (AKA pH7CMS), you have to make sure that you didn't rename
the `_protected` folder.

The database configuration has less options. For instance, you can't change the prefix when creating the tables in the
database, meaning you won't be able to have two same installations using the same database (if so, you will have to
create a second database, or using the [traditional Web installer](http://ph7builder.com/doc/en/insall) instead).


## 🤔 How pH7Builder CLI installation can be useful

* Scaling the new [pH7Builder](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS) instances by automatizing the
  installation.
* Quick installations on Web hosting/cloud servers.
* Ideal for SaaS services, to automatically run a new pH7Builder instance in the background.
* Quick installation on local stacks for testing purpose.


## 🤕 Troubleshooting

If you occur any issues, please report
them [by raising an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/issues).

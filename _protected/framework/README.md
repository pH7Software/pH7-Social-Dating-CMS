# pH7Framework

### *The kernel of every pH7Builder installation 🚀*

**pH7Framework** is a powerful framework designed by small packages (one package = one purpose or sub-purposes). It was built with the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) in mind. The framework has been specifically written for pH7 Social Dating CMS Pro (and now known as pH7Builder).
